## Session bar-number offset — SESSION START BAR SOLVED (2026-06-30)

Pro Tools lets a session's bar numbering start at an arbitrary bar (`-22`, `-1`, `0`, `2`).
**Found + corpus-confirmed:** the session start bar is a signed `i32` at the first meter
event's +8 (block payload +23) of the `0x2029` "Meter" block; default sessions read `1`,
the renumbered `THE WIND` corpus session reads `-2`. The bar-1 tick origin `0xE8D4A51000`
is unchanged by renumbering (it's a relabel, not a tick shift). Shipped:
`body_synth.session_start_bar()` (read). See spec §5c.

**Reading event 0 is shipped:** `body_synth.base_tempo()` (session BPM, the first f64 in
[20,300] inside the `0x2028` "Tempo" block) and `base_meter()` (event-0 numerator/denominator
from the `0x2029` "Meter" block: count `u32`@payload+11, events@payload+15, start-bar
`i32`@event+8, num@+12, den@+16). Both are surfaced in `session_info()` and validated on
PT-authored controls (90/121/3-4/120→140/4-4→3-4) + all 26 corpus sessions. See spec §10.

Still open (need Pro Tools ground truth):
- **Reading a FULL multi-event map** (tempo or meter) on arbitrary sessions: events past
  event 0 are variable-length — only event 0 is mapped. Delineate the per-event record
  length so `tempo_map()` / `meter_map()` can return every event.
- **Writing** a renumbered start (and the multi-event case): same variable-length record
  blocker. Author a multi-segment meter map with a renumbered start, save, and delineate
  the per-event record length before writing.
- **Empty meter map** (`count==0`, e.g. COGNAC/MANOLITO): the i32 field only exists when
  there's ≥1 meter event. Renumber such a session in PT and find where the value lands
  (a forced `count=1` event, or a session-setup block like `0x2305`/`0x230A`?).
- The exact tick↔bar conversion once a session is renumbered (does anything else move?).

Why it matters: lets us place a musical downbeat on **Bar 1** with pickups in bars
`0 / -1 / …` natively (the proper fix for the beatmap-importer count-in approximation),
and round-trips renumbered sessions losslessly.

## Placement → region link — SOLVED (2026-06-30)

The `0x104F` placement's `u32` at **+11** is a **0-based index into the `0x2629`
region-instance list** (file order); the clip's source name is the `0x2628` name nested in
that `0x2629`. Corpus-confirmed: the bak.076 added clips resolve to the added regions, and a
`Wolf Wet` track's clips resolve to `Wolf Wet.L/.R`. Refs are **positional** (an insert
before index N renumbers refs ≥ N — load-bearing for add-clip). Shipped:
`body_synth.clip_names(data, lane_zmark)`. See spec §5c.

## 0x2628 region geometry — DESCRIPTOR MODEL FOUND, slot-meaning needs PT

Round-2: after the name (`noff = z+13+namelen`) a 5-byte descriptor `[b0..b4]` precedes
variable-width LE **sample** fields whose byte-widths are the nibbles of `b1,b2,b3` (slot
order `[b1.hi,b1.lo,b2.hi,b2.lo,b3.hi,b3.lo]`, 0 = absent); `b4` = form marker (`0x08`
trimmed / `0x00` whole-file). The model reproduces exactly on clean families (final field =
clip length in samples) — but the slot→meaning map is NOT stable across subtypes (grouped
`.grp` regions + some `0x1004` record types break it), and "final field == source length"
was refuted as universal. Positions are raw samples, NOT origin-relative ticks. To finish:
author PT sessions with known clip start/length (whole-file vs trimmed sub-region, and a
grouped region) and pin each slot. Gate for add/replace-clip. (See spec §5d.)

## 0x104F placement position — SOLVED; second variant tail open

Round-2 confirmed: position is the `u64` at `+16` (already shipped as `clip_positions` /
`set_clip_position`); sample-track = plain samples, tick-track =
`0x4000000000000000 + 0xE8D4A51000 + tickoff` with the timebase in the top byte at `+23`
(`0x00`=sample, `0x40`=tick, other nibbles opaque). `+11` = the `0x2629` region index.
Remaining (needs PT): the size-37 / subtype-`0x000A` variant's 3 extra tail bytes, and the
per-clip enum at `+24` (1/2/3) — author clips with/without a fade or sync point and diff.

## Automation `0x260A` — re-derive (variable breakpoint array)

Round-2 refuted the "fixed 39-byte single breakpoint" model: `0x260A` is VARIABLE-length and
holds an inner breakpoint **array** (count near payload+10; ~6 B/breakpoint + 6-byte
terminator). `flag@payload+8` ⇄ tick-present is exact; `tick@payload+18` = 5-byte absolute
conductor tick. Re-derive the per-breakpoint (tick, value) record and the lane→parameter
(volume/pan/mute/plugin) linkage. Lower priority — automation is in the "leave intact" set
for clip/track edits, but needed for an automation editor.

## Track GUID / 0x260E routing — needs PT

`0x261B → 0x102D` carries an 8-byte track GUID (after a `2A 00 00 00` tag) and cross-track
links are GUID-keyed; `0x260E` destination names are length-prefixed latin1 but not at
block end, and some slots (record-id `0xFFFF`) are unassigned. Confirm in PT which track-list
block holds each track type's GUID (a GUID showed up in a `0x251A`-family block for an audio
track) and which `0x260D` routing slots mean "unassigned". Groundwork for add/remove-track.

## add / remove-track — scoped (the next big build)

Ground truth exists in the chains: Rewire bak.078→079 ADDS a track (Δ0x261B +1), Hipsters
bak.044→045 REMOVES one (Δ0x261B −1, Δ0x1014 −1). Footprint per spec §5e. The crux vs.
clip edits: a track's blocks are **indexed** (0x1014/0x251A track-list entry, 0x1052 lanes,
0x261C playlists, the 0x261B subtree), so the reindex is a **rank-rebuild** of the master
index (remove/renumber the records for the removed track's blocks) — NOT the pure
offset-shift that clip edits use. Also the lanes of ALL audio tracks share ONE 0x1054
container (Stanaj: one 6.7KB 0x1054 holds all 16 lanes), so remove-track splices lanes out
of the shared container rather than dropping a per-track container. And the 0x251A track
list appears DUPLICATED (two copies in Stanaj).

PRECISE FOOTPRINT (ground truth: Hipsters bak.044→045 removes the EMPTY track 'GTR 13.dup2';
the simultaneous +7-clip add is separable via positive deltas). An empty-track removal
deletes **28 content-types / ~70 blocks**: the 0x261B subtree (0x261b, 0x102d, 0x2619,
0x2627, 0x260d, 0x260a×3, 0x260c×2, 0x260e×3, 0x1029, 0x2434, the view chain 0x2015/0x200a/
0x200b/0x2037×3/0x2038×3, the plugin cluster 0x1038×2/0x2613×2/0x2614×2/0x2615×2/0x2616×2),
the scaffolding (0x2506×13, 0x2625×9, 0x2626×11), the track-list entries (0x1014, 0x251a×2),
the playlist 0x261c, and the empty lane 0x1052×1. Of these, only **6 are INDEXED** (referenced
by master-index child_refs OR element offsets): **0x1014, 0x251a, 0x1052, 0x261b, 0x261c,
0x2627**. So the reindex = offset-shift for the 22 non-indexed types + a bounded RANK-REBUILD
(remove the index refs + renumber) for those 6. Plus editing the shared name table 0x2519
(the name is inside it, not a separate block) and the display-order 0x2624.

Sub-problems: (a) IDENTIFY one track's complete block-set — name-bearing blocks by name, the
0x261B subtree by containment, but the scaffolding (0x2506 per marker×track, 0x2625/0x2626
under the track's 0x2627) needs per-track attribution; (b) build the index rank-rebuild for
the 6 indexed types (remove a child_ref = splice 11 B + decrement the record count; remove an
element offset = splice 4 B + decrement k; then offset-shift). Validate: reproduce bak.045's
structure (track gone, other tracks byte-intact) + holes resolve + rc=0. Start with the
empty-track case (no clips/lanes-with-clips), then generalize to tracks with clips.
